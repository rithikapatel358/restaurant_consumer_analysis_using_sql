🍽️ Restaurant & Consumer Data Analysis using SQL
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on organizing and analyzing restaurant and consumer behavior data using SQL. Multiple CSV files are transformed into a relational database, and SQL queries are used to uncover insights related to consumer preferences, restaurant performance, cuisine trends, and ratings

🎯 Project Objectives

Organize restaurant-related consumer data into a structured SQL database

Analyze consumer–restaurant interactions using SQL

Apply core and advanced SQL concepts:

WHERE

JOINs

Aggregations

Subqueries

CTEs

Window Functions

Derive actionable insights such as:

Consumer behavior patterns

Restaurant performance evaluation

Cuisine preferences

Rating trends

Build a recommendation-style analytical foundation using SQL

🗂️ Dataset Description

Source: Multiple CSV files

Domain: Restaurant & Consumer Analytics

Data Includes:

Consumer demographics & lifestyle

Restaurant details

Cuisine preferences

Consumer ratings (Food, Service, Overall)

🧱 Database Tables

The relational database consists of the following tables:

Consumers

Restaurants

Ratings

Consumer_Preferences

Restaurant_Preferences

Relationships are maintained using primary keys and foreign keys, as represented in the ER Diagram.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

SQL

MySQL / PostgreSQL

DB Tool: MySQL Workbench / pgAdmin

Platform: Windows

🔍 SQL Concepts Implemented

Filtering with WHERE

Multi-table JOINs

Aggregate Functions (AVG, COUNT)

Subqueries & Correlated Subqueries

Derived Tables

Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Window Functions (RANK)

Logical filtering & order of execution

📊 Sample Analysis Performed

Identify students who are smokers and their demographics

Analyze restaurants serving wine & beer with medium pricing

Evaluate franchise vs independent restaurant performance

Find top-rated restaurants and cuisine trends
